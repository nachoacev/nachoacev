# About me

I am a mathematical engineer and physicist from the University of Chile. I am currently persuing a PhD in maths at Universit√© Paris-Saclay, specifically at the Institute de Mathematiques d'Orsay. Previously I completed a master's degree Mathematics and Applications *(M2 Analysis, Modelisation, and Simulation)* also at Universit√© Paris-Saclay.

Nowadays I am here to pulish my skills in data science and modelisation (refresh knoledge in ML, DL, statistics, visualization of data, etc) to be able to participate in part-time jobs.

Here you will find:

- Examples of codes in python related to maths (PDEs, Stochastic processes, machine learning, modelisation).
- Examples of codes in R related to statistics.
- Programming in pytorch for Deep Learning stuff.
- Maybe some articles in latex or pdf (from my research).
